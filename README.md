## Documentation

There is no wiki or documentation for this library, but once we push a first stable release, we will start working on it.<br/>
That being said, if you read the source, it's not too difficult to figure out how everything works.

## Compilation

This library can be compiled using javac, or you can use the .jar supplied to you in the Releases tab.

## Contacting me
