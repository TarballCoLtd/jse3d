## Credit

The majority of the code from lines 62 to 94 in the com.emeryferrari.jse3d.Display class was written by Sam Krug.<br/>
All other code was written by Emery Ferrari.

## Documentation

There is no wiki or documentation for this library, but once we push a first stable release, we will start working on it.<br/>
That being said, if you read the source, it's not too difficult to figure out how everything works.

## Compilation

This library can be compiled using javac, or you can use the .jar supplied to you in the Releases tab.

## Future plans

In the future, we plan to turn this into a physics engine capable of simulating gravity, air resistance, and friction.<br/>
There is no ETA for these features, however these features will be added within the somewhat near future.
